# Las

## About

“Las” is a game about a man who wanted to eat a roasted chicken in the wilderness. He embarks on a journey that leads him to an ordinary forest. He sets up a camp and lights a campfire. Unfortunately, luck is not on his side. You have to help him keep the campfire going so he can have his delicious roasted chicken!

## Running the code

The game was made using Unity 2019.3.10f1. You will need it to run/compile the code(though it will probably work with older/newer versions of Unity).

3rd part assets used in the project:
 - BOXOPHOBIC's Skybox Extended Shader
 - Footstep(Snow and Grass) by MGWSoundDesign
 - Tinyfire VFX
